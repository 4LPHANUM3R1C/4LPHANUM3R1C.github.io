        <h2 class=mee>
            I am a student at Math and Science College Prep. I'm 14.
            I started coding in 6th grade, as a major. I have 2.5 sibilings, 
            1.5 brothers and a sister. 
            My favorite solo videogames are <a href="http://www.thinkwithportals.com/" class=normal>Portal 2</a> &
            <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/" class=normal>Overwatch</a>, and with friends I like <a href="http://www.castlecrashers.com/" class=normal>Castle Crashers</a>,
            <a href="https://minecraft.net/" class=normal>Minecraft</a>, & <a href="http://littlebigplanet.playstation.com/" class=normal>Little Big Planet</a>.
            I my favorite TV shows are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/" class=normal>Rick & Morty</a> & 
            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1942683/" class=normal>The Amazing World of Gumball.</a>
            
            In 7th grade, I took a computer science class for half a semester. This is where I found my perfect career: A video game designer and programmer. I always loved art since I was a kid, & video games are ultimate combination of the two. In order to get that job, I'll need to get a degree in computer science or something of the like. I could showcase my website & other coding projects as part of my resume. I also will need to take a typing class, so I could work faster. 
            <br />
My best strengths are my optimism and my ability to cooperate well with others. Whenever a challenge is put in my way, I usually treat the issue with a calm temperament and a positive attitude. On the other hand, I'm not very assertive or ambitious. If someone has an idea, I'll often go with that idea, even if I have a better one. Also, I prefer to take the road more traveled as opposed to blazing my own path. However, these negative traits are eclipsed by what I've been able to do while being positive and cooperative. In 8th grade, I was doing poorly in History class. My only chance to get a good grade was to ace the final project. In the end, I pulled through and got a B as my final grade.
            <br />
In conclusion, My ability to cooperate with others is perfect for working on large coding projects. Thank you for your time.
